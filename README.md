📌 Project: Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project demonstrates a machine learning model that can automatically recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from images. It uses the MNIST dataset, which contains thousands of handwritten digit samples. The model is trained using deep learning techniques to classify digits with high accuracy.

🔑 Key Features:

Input: Handwritten digit image (28x28 pixels).

Output: Predicted digit (0–9).

Uses Neural Networks / CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for classification.

High accuracy achieved through training on the MNIST dataset.

Can be extended for real-world applications like digit recognition in forms, postal codes, and bank cheques.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

🚀 Applications:

Automating handwritten digit recognition in documents.

Educational tool for learning computer vision and deep learning.

Base for building more advanced image classification models.
